# aether-ai-gateway

> **Status: Documentation phase.** No application code or production deployment has been started in this repository.

## Purpose

Provider-independent model access, routing, request normalization, streaming, timeouts, and provider policy enforcement.

## Responsibility boundary

AI model boundary; does not own UI, user billing, or agent planning.

## Dependencies

aether-ai-providers, aether-ai-security, aether-ai-observability; optional AI DIAL integration behind an adapter.

## Project rules

- Keep WoHoTech separate; this repository belongs to the new Aether AI project.
- Treat the existing [WoHo AI DevKit](https://github.com/Monupatel62/woho-ai-devkit) as a separate dependency. Do not copy or rewrite it without a reviewed technical reason.
- No implementation starts until the documentation and cross-repository contracts are reviewed.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, user data, or production credentials.
- Public interfaces, security decisions, and non-obvious implementation choices must be documented.

## Before coding

Read the project specification, architecture, contracts, implementation plan, and work log. Update the docs in the same change whenever behavior, an API contract, a dependency, or a security boundary changes.
